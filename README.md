# iChallenge U

Create custom leaderboards to compete with friends!

## How it works

- Create a new challenge with a start date and a specified number of days the challenge will last.
- Invite users via an open invite link or by phone number.
- Each day, users will have the opportunity to log a completion for the day and upload photographic evidence if required by the group.
- Check back to see a leaderboard ranking participants based on their current streak and total completions.
- When the challenge ends, the leaderboard will be updated with a trophy case featuring the winners of the challenge.
- Have fun!
